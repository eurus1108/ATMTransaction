## Contribution Guidelines
Welcome to the final case study! I appreciate if you contribute to this project. By participating in this project you agree to abide by the following guidelines.

### 💡 Getting Started
1. Fork the repository on Github.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Project-Name.git
   cd Project-Name
   ```
3. Set up the upstream repository.
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/Project-Name.git
   ```
4. Create a new branch for your contribution.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

### 🔨 Making Changes
1. Before starting any work, make sure to pull the latest changes from the upstream repository.
   ```
   git pull upstream master
   ```
2. Implement your changes.
3. Write clear and concise commit messages.
4. Test your changes locally.

### 🔁 Submitting Changes
1. Push your changes to your forked repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```
2. Open a pull request (PR against the `main`) branch of the upstream repository.
3. Clearly describe your changes in the PR and provide context on why they are necessary.
4. Ensure your PR title and description follow the project's guidelines.
5. Be responsive to feedback and be prepared to make changes if requested.

### 📝 Writing Commit Messages
Please [write a great commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).
1. Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Captilize the subject line
4. Do not end with a period
5. Use the impreative mood in the subject line (example: "Fix networking issue)
6. Wrap the body at around 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain why, not what and how (the code shows that!)

   
### 💅 Branch Naming Convention
- Use a prefix for your branch that reflects the type of change:
  - `feature/` for new features.
  - `bugfix/` for bug fixes.
  - `docs/` for documentation.
  - `chore/` for routine tasks, maintenance, or tooling.

### ✅ Code Review Process
All contributions will be reviewed by me. Please be patient during the process.
